# Repo for registry 1445 of the ERC J-Innovatech project

The 1445 Toll Register is the unique surviving medieval customs register in Japan. As such, it is a precious window into Japanâ€™s medieval commercial revolution. While well studied using traditional methods, the J-InnovaTech has provided an opportunity to operate a pilot analysis using SNA methods. The idea was to highlight the potential of statistical, spatial and  network analysis, producing visualizations which nuance our understanding of the role of commercial agents in the medieval maritime trade.
